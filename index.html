<br>              
        <p><b>1. Mentorship-</b> Students tend to make mistakes mainly due to a lack of proper guidance.

              Serving the society not only adds to his/her CV but a person's personal growth as well.
              Therefore, we tie-up with big Organizations for our members to carry out volunteer work.</p><br>
        <p><b>3. Internships-</b> The most talked about yet confusing part of college.
              How to choose the right internship? We tend to connect you with us and for Internships in various domains like HR, Content Writing, Graphic Designing, Etc.</p><br>
        <p><b>4. Networking-</b> Acquiring skills is useful only if you have a good network to utilize them.
              We host regular meet-ups, events for our community members to broaden their network and connect them to well-established people.</p><br>
